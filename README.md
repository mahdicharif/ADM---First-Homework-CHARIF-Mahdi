# ADM - First Homework CHARIF Mahdi
 This repository contains all the folders and files of the first homework. I have completed all the challenges and exercises (all of the 1985 points).

Alongside this readme file, I have attached the following documents :

- A pdf file (submissions.pdf), containing all the submissions I have made on hackerrank.

- A python file (scripts.py), containing the commented codes of each exercises. The title of the exercises is reminded before each program.
